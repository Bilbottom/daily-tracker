# Daily Tracker ‚è±Ô∏èüìù

An application for keeping track of tasks throughout the day.

Not sure where all your time goes? I wasn't either üòÑ This application generates a pop-up box every 15 minutes (configurable) to fill out what you're currently working on.

> This is a work in progress. I'm currently using it to track my time, but it's not yet ready for public consumption.

## ‚ú® Features

The GUI is currently built with [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and looks like:

<div align="center">

</div>

This pop-up box has the following features:

- Drop-down box to select from recent projects
- Drop-down box to select the selected project's recent details
- By default, autopopulates the project and details from the previous entry
- Has a Streamlit front-end for viewing and editing the data

  - Reads the calendar and autofills with meeting information
- Integrates with [Jira <img alt="Jira Software" height="12px" src="https://example.atlassian.net/favicon.ico">](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)
  - Reads tickets in the current sprint and adds them to the project drop-down
  - Adds a worklog to the ticket when the form is submitted
- Integrates with [Slack <img alt="Slack" height="12px" src="https://slack.com/favicon.ico"/>](https://slack.com/)

### üçé On macOS

On macOS, you will probably need to install the Tcl/Tk framework:

```bash
brew install tcl-tk
```

This has been tested and confirmed to work on an M1 Mac with version `8.6.13` of the `tcl-tk` package, running Python `3.11.4` (installed using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)).
